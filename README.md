# Reflow Oven USB
This project converts a Mini Bake & Grill to be used as a reflow oven for soldering surfae mount pcb's. The oven was chosen for it's compact size but high power elements for its size. the even has been rewired to run both the top and bottom elements at the same time.

The controller has a USB port to allow for firmware updates and monitoring/graphing of the oven while it is running profiles. See seperate repository SMD_Profiler for more information.
